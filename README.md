Portfolio App
Welcome to my Portfolio App repository! This project showcases my personal portfolio using modern web development tools and practices.

üåü About the Project
This is a responsive and interactive portfolio website built with React and Vite. The goal of this project is to present my professional profile, skills, and projects in a visually appealing way.

üéØ Purpose
To create a central place to showcase who I am as a developer.
To demonstrate my front-end skills through a clean, responsive, and performant UI.
To provide recruiters, collaborators, or potential clients with a quick overview of my work.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The app is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
The content is structured into components like:
Home: A hero section introducing who I am.
Projects: A list of my projects with descriptions and links.
Skills: Technologies and tools I‚Äôm familiar with.
Contact: A form or links to reach out to me.
All components are styled using standard CSS to ensure a smooth and responsive experience.
The site is bundled and optimized using Vite, allowing for super-fast development and builds.
